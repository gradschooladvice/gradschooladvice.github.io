<h2 id="who-are-we">Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are three PhD students who met during our remote summer internship during the summer of 2020. Specifically, our graduate programs are all somehow related to Statistics, which means that most of our posts and our knowledge generally is most applicable to people who are also in some form of a Statistics Ph.D. program or who are interested in such a program. After bonding over Microsoft Teams, we decided it would be fun to start a blog together, especially because we recognize how this informal advice can get stuck in certain channels that not all students have access to.</p>

<p>Melody is a third year Ph.D. student at UCLA studying Statistics. Her primary research interests are in causal inference and social statistics. Besides research, she tolerates running, and enjoys coffee, board games, and telling people about the (problematic) gendered societal expectations that the Bachelor implicitly reinforces.</p>

<p>Mikaela is a third year Ph.D. student in the joint Statistics and Public Policy Ph.D. program at Carnegie Mellon University. Her research thus far has focused on applying statistics to criminal justice problems, such as racial disparities in police use-of-force, and statistics pedagogy. In her spare time, Mikaela enjoys playing every team intramural sport at CMU (in non-pandemic times), playing board games, and riding her bike.</p>
